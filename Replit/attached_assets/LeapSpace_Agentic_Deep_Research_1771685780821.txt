1. Overview
Problem Statement
Scientific researchers spend excessive time manually searching, validating, synthesizing, and tracking literature across fragmented sources. Existing tools are passive and require researchers to manually orchestrate workflows, slowing discovery and reducing research velocity.
Generative AI tools improve summarization but lack:
* Trust and verifiability

* Deep research reasoning

* Workspace context awareness

* Autonomous execution of research workflows

This creates a major opportunity for LeapSpace to deliver a trusted, autonomous research partner.
________________


Goal
Build Agentic Deep Research, an AI capability that autonomously conducts literature analysis, synthesizes findings, tracks developments, and assists in hypothesis generation within LeapSpace’s trusted workspace.
________________


Vision
LeapSpace evolves from:
Passive research workspace → Intelligent assistant → Autonomous research partner
